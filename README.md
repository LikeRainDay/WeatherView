#WeatherView
> Starting from the 1.1.0 version this library is using a different setter structure. Please look at the above documentation

WeatherView is an Android Library that helps you make a cool weather animation for your app.<br/>
This library is based on this <a href="https://github.com/plattysoft/Leonids">Leonids</a> library.

</div>



##Setup
###Android Studio / grandle
Add the following dependency to the **build.gradle** of your project:

``` 
repositories {
	maven { url = 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
	compile 'com.github.MatteoBattilana:WeatherView:1.1.0'
}
```

###Basic usage

By default the WeatherView is set to SUN, no animation is showed.
It is possible to change or initialize the weather status with the **setWeather(weatherStatus)** method.<br/>
The animation is stopped by default and must be started with **startAnimation()**. When the animation is playing and the previous method is called the animation is stopped and must be restarted. WeatherView requires minSDK 14.
<br/>
You can check the <a href="https://github.com/MatteoBattilana/WeatherView/tree/master/app/">WeatherView Demo Library source code</a>.

Here a basic example:
``` Java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        WeatherView mWeatherView = (WeatherView) findViewById(R.id.weather);
        //Optional
        mWeatherView.setWeather(Constants.weatherStatus.RAIN)
                    .setLifeTime(2000)
                    .setFadeOutTime(1000)
                    .setParticles(43)
                    .setFPS(60)
                    .setAngle(-5);
                    .startAnimation();
    }
}
```

Include WeatherView into activity_main.xml
``` Xml
<xyz.matteobattilana.library.WeatherView
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        android:id="@+id/weater"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="1dp"
        app:angle="-3"
        app:fadeOutTime="1000"
        app:fps="40"
        app:lifeTime="2200"
        app:numParticles="55"
        app:startingWeather="RAIN"/>
```


It also allows xml customization with the follow attributes:

``` Xml
		app:angle="int"
        app:fadeOutTime="int"
        app:fps="int"
        app:lifeTime="int"
        app:numParticles="int"
        app:startingWeather="{RAIN,SNOW,SUN}"
```
* **angle** is the angle of the single particle, 0 is perpendicular to the ground. This value must be greater than -180 and less than 180.
* **fps** must be greater than 7 and less than 100.
* **lifeTime** is the falling time of a single particle. After this time the particle stop exist. Must be greater than 0.
* **fadeOutTime** during lifeTime the particle starts to fade out. This fade out animation lasts the specified duration. Must be greater than 0.
* **numParticles** number of particle for a second. Must be grather than 0.
* **startingWeather** you can specify the stating weather status but **startAnimation()** MUST BE CALLED.

##Available Methods
List of the methods available on the class WeatherView.
> Since from 1.1.0 there is only one constructor.

###Configuration
Available methods for the configuration are:
* *setWeather(weatherStatus mWeatherStatus)*: RAIN, SUN or SNOW.
* *setLifeTime(int time)* Set the time of the current animation showed
* *getLifeTime()*
* *setFadeOutTime(int fadeOutTime)* Set the fadeOutTime to the all animation
* *getFadeOutTime()*
* *setParticles(int particles)* Set the particles of the current animation showed
* *getParticles()*
* *setAngle(int angle)* Set the angle of every single particle of the current animation showed 
* *getAngle()*
* *setFPS(int fps)* once you call this method the animation is atomatically stopped by default with the **cancelAnimation()** method.
* *getFPS()*
* *startAnimation()*
* *stopAnimation()* Stops the emission of new particles, but the active ones are updated.
* *cancelAnimation()* Stops the emission of new particles, the active ones are stopped and cancelled.
* *getCurrentWeather()*
* *isPlaying()* 
* *resetConfiguration()* Reset all the values to the default values
